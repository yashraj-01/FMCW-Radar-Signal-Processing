##Base function to initialize the radar specifications and target information
##Baseband signal generator for multiple targets formed by superimposing individual IF signals.
##Baseband signal generator for single target formed by mixing transmitting and received chirps. 
##Visualizes the IF signal in range-doppler domain and obtains range and velocity from corresponding peaks.
